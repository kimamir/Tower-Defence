# Test files

It is a common practice to do unit tests of each class before you integrate it into the project to validate its operation.
In this folder, you can create your own unit test files to validate the operation of your components.

> It might be a good idea to also take some notes about the tests since you are required to 
  report these in the final report.

# Unit Tests

## Test of MyClass

**Involved Classes:** Game, Enemy, Tower

**Test File:** testwave.txt

**Results:**
We tested the game using a very simple enemy wave file. With this file we were able to see if the enemies appeared to the map. Also we were able to test that the towers shoot and firing towards enemies will kill them.
